## What I believe in?

__A hipster developer who believes code `maintainability` and `extensibility` are of paramount importance in software development; libraries and frameworks come last.__

---

## Open Source

* Author and maintainer of [Gringotts](https://github.com/aviabird/gringotts) a payment gateway integrator library based on shopify's [activemerchant](https://github.com/activemerchant/active_merchant).
* Author and maintainer of [AngularSpree](https://github.com/aviabird/angularspree) an open source frontend e-commerce framework in [Angular 2.x+](https://angular.io).

I have worked with `Ruby on Rails`, `Elixir`, `Phoenix framework`, `AngularJs`, `Angular(2.x+)`, `ReactJs`, `Golang`, `NodeJS`.

## Currently reading

While internet is a great place for finding documentation, [tips & tricks](https://stackoverflow.com/) for our day-to-day job as software programmers, there is no replacement for reading a good book about a language or programming. I make it a point to read a book once in a while. It has really helped me along the way and I highly recommend it.

_Currently reading super awesome [Elixir in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action)_
